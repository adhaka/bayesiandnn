# bayesiandnn
package for semi supervised learning for phoneme recognition using deep generative models- a marriage of bayesian world with Deep Neural Networks
and applying it on frame based phoneme recogniton. This package will contain routines to train a multi layer neural network with bayesian optimisation
of the hyperparameters. MORE DETAILS TO COME ...
